# Employee_Directory_JP

## A React application to view a list of employees by state or sort by last name.

### Open the appication with the link below... The employees populated are from the API from https://randomuser.me/.
You can sort them by last name or by their state of residence. If employees do not show up from some states, it is because the API did not return that
state. Make sure to refresh employees in between sorting by last name and filtering by state.
